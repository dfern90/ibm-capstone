Falcon 9 First Stage Landing Prediction
Overview

This capstone project focuses on predicting the successful landing of the Falcon 9 first stage. SpaceX's Falcon 9 rocket launches, advertised at $62 million, stand out due to the ability to reuse the first stage, a significant cost-saving strategy. Predicting the first stage landing outcome becomes crucial in determining launch costs. This information holds value for competing companies bidding against SpaceX for rocket launches.
